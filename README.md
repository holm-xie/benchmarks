Benchmarks
==========

Here we keep open source benchmarks that were used and developed in the RELEASE project:

* DE-Bench -- a scalable reliable peer-to-peer benchmarking tool for distributed Erlang based on Basho Bench. It measures throughput and latency of distributed Erlang commands on a set of Erlang nodes.

* Orbit -- is a symbolic computing kernel and a generalization of a transitive closure computation.
