Benchmarks
==========

Here we keep open source benchmarks that were developed and used in the RELEASE project:

* Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) is a population-based metaheuristic that has proved to be successful in finding approximate solutions to difficult optimization problems, such as scheduling problems, routing problems, and allocation problems.

* DE-Bench -- a scalable reliable peer-to-peer benchmarking tool for distributed Erlang based on Basho Bench. It measures throughput and latency of distributed Erlang commands on a set of Erlang nodes.

* IM -- an instant messaging application.

* Orbit -- a symbolic computing kernel and a generalization of a transitive closure computation.

Scripts to run the benchmarks on Beowulf clusters (Heriot-Watt and GPG), Kalkyl, TinTin, and ATHOS are available on requires.
