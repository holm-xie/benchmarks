IM
==========

IM is a generic instant messaging application that has some level of agreement with real life IMs in terms of general functionality, number of messages and users. The benchmark follows client-server pattern, where the server side supports the IM functionality, and the client side provides the traffic generation.

* RD-IM is a reliable distributed Erlang IM implementation.

* SD-IM is a reliable SD Erlang IM implementation that uses s_groups to reduce the number of connections between the nodes.

* Instructions.txt provides instructions on running the benchmark.
